# Client Segmentation

The aim of this project was a kind of Segmentation Analysis, i.e., to analyse a dataset of bank clients in order to perform some clustering, to group them and extract the so called "Personas". The latter are prototypes (not stereotypes!) used by banks to group people by their characteristics. This is done in order to make some customed financial advice, i.e., proposing to each individual a financial product that better suits his needs, but also for a lot of other useful applications.

The project is part of the 2021-22 course [055643 - FINTECH](https://www4.ceda.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ManifestoPublic.do?EVN_DETTAGLIO_RIGA_MANIFESTO=evento&aa=2021&k_cf=225&k_corso_la=487&k_indir=MST&codDescr=055643&lang=IT&semestre=2&idGruppo=4338&idRiga=271236), by Politecnico di Milano university.
